The Odin Project: 1

This project is the 1st project in The Odin Project's curriculum. This project aims to teach:

* HTML headings
* Links
* Images
* HTML boilerplate

... and more! (I think)

Truthfully, I already know all of this stuff. But I'll still bother with it because why not? I might as well.
